# Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring Lab

## Objective

The Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Lab is aimed to showcase how useful and powerful a FIM can be to protect sensitive files and system configurations by being able to detect and create alerts when files get created, deleted, or modified.

### Skills Learned

- Security Knowledge: I have deepened my understanding of how to detect unauthorized changes in files, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of systems.

- Incident Response: I have gained experience in handling alerts and notifications generated by the FIM system, investigating potential security incidents, and responding appropriately.

- Log Analysis: I have gotten practice in analyzing logs and alerts generated by a FIM tool to identify suspicious activity and assess the impact of file changes.

- Compliance and Best Practices: I understand how FIM fits into security compliance frameworks and best practices for securing systems.

- Problem-solving: I gained experience in addressing and troubleshooting issues related to file integrity monitoring, including false positives and system performance impacts.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh - File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Powershell

## Steps

For this Lab I will be using two virtual machines. One Machine will contain a pre-built virtual machine image in an Open Virtual Appliance(OVA) format containing the following components: Wazuh's manager, indexer, and dashboard. I will use this Wazuh OVA image with Oracle VM Virtual Box. The other virtual machine will be a Windows Server 2022 as my target machine.

1. Starting Windows Server 2022 and Wazuh OVA machine in Virtual Box.

3. After getting both the virtual machines up and running my next step is to get the Wazuh agent installed on the Windows 2022 server. From the official Wazuh documentation website, I can download the Wazuh agent and it will look like this when complete:
   
	![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69024763-cb23-40e9-8020-79f9b57da560)

4. Now I need to get the Wazuh server IP adress and the authentication key to link the Wazuh server to the Wazuh Agent.

5. To go the IP address I will run the "ip a" command:
   
	![wazuh ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb8e0f2-4cfb-48e3-8072-76b7cfecc7d9)

6. Next I will get the authenticaion key by accessing /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents on the Wazuh Manger host.
   
	![Wazuh agetn key](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75a97c1-206d-4954-8927-31e465b636f6)

7. Turning back to the Windows Server 2022 when can import our findings for the IP adress and the authentication key.

8. Now to confirm we have set Wazuh up correctly I will try and access the Wazuh dashboard using the IP address of the Wazuh host which is 192.168.100.131 in Firefox.

	 ![wazuh dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0a8705-c5b6-44d0-b66e-b4fbd51e2c77)

9. After I signed in I can see that the agent is active.

	![Wazuh agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb8cbb5c-0135-4796-bfcc-0d6340f51ea7)

10. I can now start to configure File integrity monitoring on the Windows 2022 server machine. First, I will have to navigate to This PC > Local Disk(C:) > Program Files(x86) > ossec-agent and then I will edit the ossec.conf file. Before I make changes, as best practice I will copy the ossec.conf file and rename the copy as ossec-backup.conf just incase I mess up the configuration file later on so I have a clean backup.
    
   	 ![Wazuh backup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a05aa920-4006-4b85-8a0c-7e2d40c380fc)

Since the Public and Temp directories are common places for attackers to upload their tool sets. I will select one for this lab, which will be the Public directory.


12. I will open up the ossec.conf file and will start to configure the File Ingtegrity Monitoring to monitor the Public directory. I will copy and paste one of the lines under the "Default files to be monitored" as I will make changes to the line to fit my needs.

	- The first edit will be to add the path of the dirctory that I want to be monitored which is C:\Users\Public.

	- Next, I will remove the recursion level section, leaving recursion in it will only monitor that directory and no further. To make sure the monitoring can go through multiple levels it needs to be removed and then it will monitor everything in the public directory. In my case, I do not know how many levels I will need to monitor and this will fulfill my needs.

	- The default setting for File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is to check for changes every 12 hours, I have added realtime="yes" which makes it so FIM checks for changes in realtime.

12. Now FIM is set up and let's simulate an event. I will create a file called evil-malware in the Public directory. As you can see in the Wazuh dashboard, we have an event which has identified a file that was ADDED under the C:\users\public\pictures directories as "evil-malware".

  Clicking the side arrow we can look at more specific information relation to this event. We can see the agent ID, IP, and name. We can also see the path and file that was added.
   
  ![Wazuh new fields](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203bf0e7-4072-405e-a6c8-e9feccafd2ee)

   
   
   You are also supplied with the MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hash values of the file which is really interesting as you can compare those hashes using open-source intelligence like VirusTotal to help investigate the suspected file.

In this next simulation, I am going to show a different scenario where FIM will be very useful. There are Bank records that are NOT to be modified ever. This will show how FIM can detect files that have been modified.

13. I have created a file in the public\documents directory called "classified bank records.txt" and have added text as "200.00" and then saved the file. I then opened the file back up and changed the text to "20000.00" and saved it.

 As show in the picture we can clearly see that this classified file never to be modified has been modified, We are now alerted and can begin an investigation into this incident.

![Wazuh Bank record modified](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7822954a-0896-475f-a2a7-481c9a472649)
 
Now I want to show another use for FIM. We can set up FIM to monitor registry keys which are commonly used for persistence. To simulate this I will create a registry key under the HKey local machine run key which will be named "UnusualFile-evil".

# Advanced Settings 

14. Now that we have gone over the basics of FIM, I want to get into some advanced configurations including who made changes to the file and what program or process was used by enabling whodata. Also to note, whodata automatically checks for changes using real time.

- Open up ossec.conf and replace the realtime attribute with whodata.

![Wazuh who data new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d19f1ca-3bf5-4eba-80f1-8817123c3e7c)

  - Enabling whodata will add these fields to the alert.

![Waazuh whodtaa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0da08638-3ed7-4c70-9198-fa1f54ca38cb)

15. Another addition that we can use to provide us even more data is the report_changes attribute. You can use whodata and report_changes together like so: 

![Wazuh who data and report changes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40b4c7f-6813-408c-889f-b2fae3dfcf87)

 16. One last scenario to show how whodata and report_changes can work together. I have created a school grades file with students grades.

![Wazuh school Grades part 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1555e198-c16b-4c89-9e4d-2e23751753a9)

 19. I have gone into that file and changed the student's grades and Wazuh made an alert.
     
![Wazuh school Grades ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201471b3-d3c1-4d66-b621-b83c43f96b5f)

 Before we couldn't tell much more than it has been changed, but let's take a look into the alert fields with our new attributes.

Looking at the syscheck.diff our original value is above the line and the modified value is below the line. As you can see FIM is very powerful for detecting unauthorized changes to files and system configurations when implemented.
